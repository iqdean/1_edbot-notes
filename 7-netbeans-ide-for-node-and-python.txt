--- install ide for nodejs ----
$ sudo apt-get install codelite codelite-plugins

> Log out and Log back in
  then see Codelite IDE icon on the desktop

--- see if codelite can highlite nodejs code ----
codelite crashes and the highliting for *.js sucks

--- uninstall codelite ----
$ sudo apt-get purge codelite codelite-plugs
$ sudo apt-get autoremove   <-- this removed joystick and jstest since these were part of
                                the xboxdrv package which got purged a while back...
				so, you might have to reinstall these if needed

Plugin Description
Installing this plugin automatically activates Dark Metal look and feel theme in your IDE.
You can also choose Dark Nimbus look and feel in Tools - Options - Miscellaneous - Windows.
Both dark themes are designed to match Norway Today editor color profile. Use menu Tools -
Options to switch back to the default look and feel or simply deactivate this plugin.

Restart

KEWL! It works... we got a dark theme with code highlighting

--- looking thru the list of plugins, theres one for python ...
    since ros uses python and c/c++, we should be able to all 3
    with netbeans ide

install python plugin for netbeans
----------------------------------

After restart, Tools > Options  shows Python

Activate C/C++
-------------
Tools > Options > C/C++ > Activate

Ok, now we should have JavaScript/Nodejs, Python, and C/C++ support
all thru 1 IDE!!


----- Install Atom IDE on ubu1404 ------
