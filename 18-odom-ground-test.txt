==== OK, now we ready for some off-bench onroad ground tests of odometry to see what kind of calibration we need =====

1. Do full backup of edison image to github

1.1 sync notes and code changes to github from BOTH 
    ACER - 17-x notes on final bkm for 3 machine ros network (edison, acer, hp)  <- this took way too long to find working
    HPDM4 (this 17-x note & roslibjoy.js changes)                                   solution!!!

2. charge battery

3. find metric measuring tape

4. do rudimentry check of odometry:

   4.1 mark robot starting point
   4.2 drive fwd till tf says 1m & mark robot stoping point
   4.3 measure distance

TF     Actual
--     ------
PI*Wd  ?
1m     ?
2m     ?

Draw coordiate frame on garage floor with chalk:
Put robot on 0,0
Rotate till TF says 90 deg, measure how far it actually rotated

Drive around on garage floor in everywhich direction and then come back to the 0,0 in rviz /odom
- see how far off we are to the real world 0,0 mark on the floor ?
