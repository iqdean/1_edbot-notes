$ sudo shutdown -h now         <- power down ... edison powers off even though main sw is still ON

Now how do you power back on? ... 
the usb0 eth cable also supplies power to edison
so you can actually power it over usb

Flipping the robot main power switch off and the back on doesn't do anything
cuz edison is still getting power via usb0 cable from the usb hub or laptop

in order to power edison back on, with the main still on, you have to unplug the
usb0 cable from the notebook or hub (this removes USB PWR) and then plug the
usb0 cable back in ... this powers edisons back on

in addition to this, the usb0 eth i/f is also used for flashing the edison 
board with os/firmware

between the power issue and the os/fw update, trying to use usb0-ethernet i/f
on a real robot is going to be a can of worms.

right now, we can do the manual unplug/plug cable to power edison back on after
a orderly shutdown, but in the end, we gonna need a different i/f between
edison and other onboard compute systems... rasberry pi is sounding better 
and better ea time i run into one of edison's quirks like this one
