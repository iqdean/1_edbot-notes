AFTER WASTING 2 DAYS ON TRYING TO GET UBUNTU to UBUNTU Hotspot working
the conclusion is that Ubuntu 14.04 Hotspot support is CRAP and doesn't work
worth a shit... 

PLAN B: Research &  Buy a Portable Wifi Router/AP/Hotspot for use on the robot

TL-WR802N Portable router with multiple operating modes, designed for home and travel

Use the Wireless Router Mode to establish dedicated robot Wifi network:

On Acer C720, going to have to figure out how to add a route between
usb0 network and usbEth network
